## Deque methods to implement, in order of priority
1. size()
2. isEmpty()
3. Java 8 API "Special value" methods
4. Java 8 API "Throws exception" Methods
5. Other methods

## Development Plan
1. Create a Deque interface with methods in order of priority
2. Create QQKachoo class that implements our Deque interface
3. Comment out all methods in Deque
4. Uncomment the topmost un-implemented method in Deque
5. Implement said method in QQKachoo
6. Add testers for said method in QQKachoo's main method
7. Repeat steps 4-6 until Deque is fully implemented
